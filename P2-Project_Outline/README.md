Overview
Families need a way to keep track of the chore and events that each member of the family has made a commitment to.

The Family Organizer is for families to keep track of the different events and chores that every member has scheduled. This will allow for a more efficient way to track what needs to be completed and where members of the family are. Additionally, this will help in scheduling tasks and events within the family ensuring that everything will be completed in a timely manner. List can be made for any item whether it’s for groceries, shopping, or something needed for a chore or event.
